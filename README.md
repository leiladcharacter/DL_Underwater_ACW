This is the code and associated details for the work detailed in "Deep Learning for Detection of Underwater Aircraft Wrecks from US Conflicts." Please see the paper for relavant code and model references. While the code is here presented, the data are not available because this work deals with searching for aircraft that may contain human remains.

Manuscript currently in review: Character, L.; Moline, M.; Breece, M.W.; White, E.; Davis, D., Colbourn, C. “Deep learning for detection of underwater aircraft wrecks from US Conflicts.” Journal of Computer Applications in Archaeology.

Begin with file 1a, which details the process of model training. Once model is trained, the model can be tested on new data using the process detailed in file 2b. All other files/scripts are referred to in either 1a or 1b.
